## 1. WOOW

### 1.1 Project Description

**Woow** 🧁 Woow is a bakery specialized in sugar art that started during the pandemic, and as it has focused on satisfying the needs of its customers with its excellent service and quality artisanal products, it has been well received by its public.

Due to its significant growth, it has become a bit complicated for Woow's staff to keep track of their orders, and that is why they are requesting a system that can facilitate the management of orders for the bakery staff, so they can perform better, so that the waiter can make and send the orders using a tablet and thus send them to the chef so that they are prepared in an orderly and efficient manner.

The administrator will have the possibility to create, edit and deregister (both waiter and chef) employees with accounts, will be able to add, edit and delete products in the inventory and, in addition, will have access to the orders placed to be able to keep track.

## 4. Hacker Edition

The purpose of this project is to carry out the Waiter and Chef module,
however, we are considering pushing ourselves further to complete an extra module so that the Administrator has the possibility of keeping track of the operations carried out by the staff.

## 5. Design Process

The process was carried out in six stages:

#### Analysis

Taking into account the requirements requested for the creation of the system, we defined the public to which it is directed, which is why we created the **Woow** 🧁 bakery, a Fancy-style bakery with excellent quality in products and services, but which presents a current problem: Keeping good control of orders.

#### Strategy design

This project was carried out in 6 Sprints. The strategy we applied was under the agile Scrum methodology, in which we established deadlines per Sprint with the use of Github Projects to ensure that the launch of the system coincides with what was planned, and as a platform for the deployment of our project we defined [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

#### Web architecture

We created the design ourselves with Figma, inspired by other restaurant systems and applications. In terms of UI - UX design, we kept in mind a range of pastel tones and a minimalist style to generate a sweet and attractive feeling.

The prototype includes 3 modules, one for each role (waiter, chef and administrator).

Throughout the development of the digital product, constant usability tests, code cleaning and some improvements were carried out to guarantee a pleasant experience for the user who navigates through it. Among them we can highlight:

- Creation of a dynamic clock that indicates that the creation time of a product has exceeded a defined time (as a demonstration topic the clock will indicate that it exceeds the 20 second limit).
- More data was added to the orders such as the name of the waiter who sends it and the waiter who accepts the order.
- Extra view for those products that have some specifications
  (variety of sizes per portion or if you want to add a message as an observation, in case the client is allergic to some ingredient).
- Active links in the navigation bar in case the view is the one that matches the route.
- Display of the quantity of orders according to their status.
- Changes in the distribution of elements in case the view is on desktop, such as the buttons to add product or add employee.
- Another view was added to check the products in the cart in detail.
- Implementation of a button to remove all products added to the cart.

#### Content creation

Taking into account that the waiter handles an extensive menu, the content is based on being able to view the products in a card format in which all their information can be shown, including their respective photograph. In addition, the orders will be represented in card format with all the order information (name of the client, the waiter who generated the order, the chef who accepted the order, the duration and a table of products with their prices)

#### Design and programming execution

Once we have everything mentioned above, at the time of creating the design with code
we make sure that all the tools and technologies implemented have been applied the best possible practices, following a quality standard that serves as a reference to build an accessible and efficient website, which can become more robust.

#### Launch and testing

Before making this application available to users, the appropriate quality tests were carried out, as well as retesting the user experience and thus proving that all our functionalities work. In this way we solved some small errors that occurred.
